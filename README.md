# ♻️ EcoSort – Deep Learning-Based E-Waste Image Classifier

EcoSort is a deep learning-powered web application that classifies electronic waste (e-waste) images into various categories such as Battery, Mobile, Keyboard, and more. This tool leverages convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and image preprocessing to enable intelligent and sustainable e-waste management.
